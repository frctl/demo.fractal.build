This is a demo app of [Fractal](https://fractal.build/), using the [Nunjucks adapter](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/tree/main/packages/nunjucks) and the default [Mandelbrot theme](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/tree/main/packages/mandelbrot) (with [custom colors](https://fractal.build/guide/web/default-theme.html#configuration) though).

The components showcased are purely fictional and were created solely for the demonstration. They have been made using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), bundled with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
